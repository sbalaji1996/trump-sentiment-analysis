#About

In this study, we investigate the rhetorical effects that Donald Trump’s 
Facebook statuses have on his social media followers. We begin with sentiment 
analysis of posts published over the course of his 2016 presidential campaign and 
train a classifier to determine natural language sentiment within close proximity of 
human performance. We then create a logistic regression model to prove that the 
presence certain keywords in a status can predict the overall valence of that post. In 
order to confirm our prediction that the emotional rhetoric of a status corresponds 
with users’ reactions to that post, we conduct permutation tests to ascertain the 
correlation between sentiment and particular reactions. Then, using the highvalence
indicative words yielded by our classifier, we produce visualizations that 
relate those keywords to users’ reactions on posts made by the Facebook pages for 
Donald Trump, CNN, and the New York Times. We then analyze that visual data to 
draw conclusions about Trump’s rhetoric and the effects it has on the response of 
his followers. Ultimately we find that, similar to their associations with sentiment, 
certain keywords can predict the reaction distribution of a post. We also find that 
irregular formatting, such as special punctuation and entire-word capitalization, can 
have a magnifying effect on certain reactions.
